# HDI-Data-Sort

HDI (Human Development Index) Data Sort is a **Command-line** application coded in **C++** for **Data Structures and Algorithms** at the **University of Florida**.

HDI Data Sort takes 4 values (Life Expectancy, Expected Years of Schooling, Mean Years of Schooling, Gross National Income per Capita) and sorts UN recognized countries based on any number of the values.
Custom weights can be applied to the values by the user to alter importance and see how different countries compare to each other under different conditions.

## UN HDI Report

The UN releases a report on their Human Development Index each year, but have **one** strict and un-customizable sort. This means the user can only evaluate countries by the UN's proprietary sort, by individual values, or with raw data.
We developed this program so users can have more freedom with how they digest the HDI and thereby gain more knowledge about the state of the world's countries.

The UN's HDI datasheet and proprietary sorts/rankings can be found here: https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI

## Data Structures and Algorithms

We also implemented this project using two different data structures, **bucket sort** and **merge sort**, to gain a better understanding of how to implement sorts in a real-world context as well as contextual knowledge about how different sorting methods perform and function.
